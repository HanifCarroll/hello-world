A place for a Newbie and his work.

Hey, everyone!  I recently decided that it would be good for me to learn how to program, so after finishing CodeAcademy's Python course, I looked around and saw it recommended that I sign up here.  I'm brand new to all of this, but maybe one day I can make a career out of it.
